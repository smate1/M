          The AIFC Court and International Arbitration Centre (IAC) have completed more than 900 cases consisting of
          Court judgments, arbitration awards, and mediation settlements, since their commencement of operations on 1
          January 2018. These results are unprecedented for dispute resolution institutions at an international
          financial centre which has only been operating for four years.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          The disputes involved a wide range of commercial and investment related matters, including finance,
          construction, sales and services contracts, and employment. The applicable laws in the disputes included AIFC
          law and the laws of Kazakhstan and Russia. All Court judgments and arbitration awards were enforced within the
          Republic of Kazakhstan to 100% satisfaction of the parties using the AIFC Court’s special step by step
          enforcement procedure that operates directly between the AIFC Court and the enforcement authorities without
          involvement of the national courts.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          The AIFC Court and IAC gained significant international recognition in 2021. The parties in the cases came
          from 19 countries, including most of the CIS countries, and globally from key Republic of Kazakhstan trading
          partners including China, India, and 15 Belt and Road Initiative countries as a part of the ‘AIFC Court and
          IAC BRI Initiative’. The AIFC Court and IAC model dispute resolution clauses were included in more than 5,700
          business contracts of industry leaders, including Chevron Tengizchevroil LLP and North Caspian Operating
          Company (NCOC), with combined contract value in excess of US $2 billion. 326 lawyers from 29 jurisdictions (27
          countries) joined the AIFC Court for rights of audience to enable them to represent clients in cases at the
          AIFC Court.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          The AIFC Court participated at the annual Standing International Forum of Commercial Courts which comprises
          Chief Justices and Registrars from the senior courts of more than 40 jurisdictions. The AIFC Court and IAC
          gave more than 60 lead speeches at local, regional and global conferences, including with key AIFC Court and
          IAC MOU partners in Asia and Europe as a part of their enhanced promotions campaign. They also hosted the
          first annual IAC-Vis Central Asia Pre-Moot competition with 22 teams from 17 countries and a Final that was
          presided over by the IAC Chairman, Barbara Dohmann QC, and the fourth annual AIFC Court and IAC Moot
          Competition and a Final that was presided over by three senior AIFC Court Justices and opening remarks by the
          AIFC Court Chief Justice, The Rt. Hon. The Lord Mance.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          The AIFC Court and IAC continued, as independent self-managed institutions that give final decisions which
          cannot be overturned by any court in the Republic of Kazakhstan, continued their close cooperation with the
          Republic of Kazakhstan Supreme Court. The cooperation included continued meetings, lectures and training
          webinars. Of particular note was the Transfer of Cases Scheme that was agreed between the Supreme Court and
          the AIFC Court and IAC to enable quick and cost effective transfer of commercial disputes, with the written
          consent of the parties in a dispute, from the national courts of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the AIFC Court
          and IAC. One case was accepted for jurisdiction by the Chief Justice of the AIFC Court, Lord Mance, and is
          currently being considered for judgment by one of the AIFC Court Justices.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          Engagement with the AIFC Court and IAC users’ community continued with three Users’ Committee meetings
          comprising representation from the senior partners of more than 15 law firms and other organisations, enhanced
          dispute resolution webinars and training programmes attended by more than 1000 people, and structured
          internships for more than 20 law students.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          The AIFC Court and IAC developed their 2025 Vision with plans to further develop the AIFC Court and IAC to
          global elite status. The plans focus on stability, growth and recognition. As a part of the plans to achieve
          long term stability, all of the judges of the AIFC Court and the Registrar and Chief Executive of the AIFC
          Court and IAC, Mr. Christopher Campbell-Holt, committed to continue in their roles at the AIFC Court for
          another five years, securing the AIFC Court’s continued long term development as a world class independent and
          impartial commercial court.
        </p>
        <p class="post__text">
          To secure the long term future of the IAC, in addition to the continuation of Mr. Campbell-Holt as the IAC
          Registrar and Chief Executive, Mr. Thomas Kruemmel was appointed to be the new IAC Chairman from 1 January
          2023. Mr. Kruemmel is an IAC Arbitrator Panel member and has many years of international arbitration and
          mediation experience as a global leader in the law with specific experience of commercial dispute resolution
          from Europe, particularly in Germany, where he is a partner at the law firm Meyer-Koering in Berlin, Germany.
          He is a member of numerous law committees and has law degrees from Bonn, Germany, and the University of
          Glamorgan, Wales. He was awarded the Chevalier dans l'ordre national du mérite award from France. His
          appointment as IAC Chairman from 2023 will enhance the IAC’s credentials as a world class international
          arbitration centre. The first IAC Chairman, Ms. Barbara Dohmann QC, who has been instrumental to the
          establishment and development of the IAC as the number one choice for arbitration and mediation disputes in
          Eurasia, will retire from her IAC chairmanship on 31 December 2022.

              “2021 was another very successful year for the IAC. We had an unprecedented number of arbitration awards and mediation
              settlements for a new centre at this stage of its operations. We collaborated successfully with arbitrators, mediators,
              and partner ADR institutions from around the world. The IAC provided a large number of webinars and training programmes
              on current arbitration and mediation matters, and it generally contributed to the promotion and development of
              arbitration and mediation in Eurasia. Investors can take comfort that the long term future of the IAC as an independent
              world class arbitration and mediation institution is secure; continuity has been assured by the appointment of RA Thomas
              Kruemmel, IAC Arbitrator Panel member and Partner at the internationally focused law firm Meyer-Koering in Berlin,

              fourth year of
              operations. The AIFC Court has given 21 judgments and has ongoing case work including a range of
              contractual disputes in
              the commercial field. I am particularly pleased that, despite the pandemic, the AIFC Court has not been
              confined to
              remote hearings but has recently heard its first case in its world class premises in Nur-Sultan,
              Kazakhstan. I welcome

              transferred
              from the national courts of the Republic of Kazakhstan to, and has so been dealt with by, the AIFC Court.
              I am also
              grateful to all the other Justices of the Court and to the Registrar and Chief Executive for recently
              renewing their
